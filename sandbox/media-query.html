          And he shall go forth, suffering pains and afflictions and temptations
          of every kind; and this that the word might be fulfilled which saith
          he will take upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his people.

          Do not suppose, because it has been spoken concerning restoration,
          that ye shall be restored from sin to happiness. Behold, I say unto
          you, wickedness never was happiness.
