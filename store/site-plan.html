			<h2>Content</h2>
			<h3>Home page</h3>
			<p><img src="photos/flower-no-sleeve.jpg" alt="Flower swimsuit with no sleeves"> <img src="photos/long-sleeve.jpg" alt="Long sleeve blue swimsuit"> <img src="photos/pink-white-flower-long.jpg" alt="Pink and white flower swimsuit with long sleeves"> <img src="photos/teal-long-many.jpg" alt="teal long sleeve swimsuit"></p>
			<h3>[Page 2]</h3>
			<p><img src="photos/teal-long-many.jpg" alt="teal swimsuit with long sleeves"> Color and Pattern: The swimsuit is in a vibrant shade of turquoise, which is often associated with calmness and sophistication. It features an embossed floral pattern, adding a touch of femininity and elegance to the design.
				Design: This swimsuit has long sleeves, which is not a common feature in traditional swimwear. The long sleeves provide more coverage and can offer additional protection from the sun.
				Front Zipper: There’s a front zipper that goes halfway down the torso, allowing the wearer to adjust the neckline to their comfort.
				Overall, this swimsuit combines functionality with style, making it a unique choice for beach or poolside wear. It’s a great example of how swimwear can be both practical and fashionable.</p>
